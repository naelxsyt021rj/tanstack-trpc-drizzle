```

## Usage

Once your development server is running, you can start modifying the source files. The project is set up to automatically reload on changes, so you can see your updates in real-time.

### Adding New Components

To add a new component, create a new file in the `src/components/` directory. For example:

```jsx
// src/components/MyComponent.jsx
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return <div>Hello, World!</div>;
};

export default MyComponent;
```

### Fetching Data

Use React Query and tRPC to fetch data. Here's a simple example:

```jsx
import { useQuery } from 'react-query';
import { trpc } from '../utils/trpc';

const DataFetchingComponent = () => {
  const { data, isLoading } = useQuery('getData', () => trpc.getData());

  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;

  return <div>Data: {JSON.stringify(data)}</div>;
};
```

### Styling with Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS makes it easy to style your components. You can apply utility classes directly in your JSX:

```jsx
const StyledComponent = () => {
  return <div className="bg-blue-500 text-white p-4">Styled Component</div>;
};
```
